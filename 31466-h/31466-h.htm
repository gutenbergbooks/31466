COUNCIL OF DOGS.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why a <span class="smcap">Council</span> of <span class="smcap">Dogs</span> was convened on the Plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <span class="smcap">President Sheep Dog</span> thus rose to explain.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"This meeting I call, to complain of misusage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the poets, who now a days have a strange usage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of leading up Insects and Birds to Parnassus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, without rhyme or reason, unnotic'd they pass us.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declare then those talents by which we may claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some pretensions, I hope, to poetical fame.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I</i> boast of whole legions, my voice who obey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without me the Sheep, e'en the Shepherd, might stray&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no more of myself&mdash;Let each Dog of spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand forward and modestly state his own merit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I charge you be gentle, let's hear of no growling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No grinning, no snarling, no snapping, no howling."<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i2">The <span class="smcap">Greyhound</span> first rose, with a spring from his seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarcely bending the grass, that grew under his feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His figure was airy, and placid his mien;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to flash in his eye indignation was seen.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Brave companions," said he, "shall <i>we</i> noble beasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear of <i>Butterflies Balls</i> and <i>Grasshoppers Feasts</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear dinned in our ears, wherever we roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Mask seeing Lion</i> and <i>Peacock at Home</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we hear all this, nor assert the fair fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for ages long past has distinguished our name?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid it ye Dogs!&mdash;here behold me stand forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To proclaim to the world my deserts, and my worth!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen and swift in the chace, I can boldly declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my speed, as I follow, in vain flies the Hare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, while like the wind, I bound over the course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My master comes lagging behind on his Horse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt friends, I could laugh, at beholding the fuss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boasting men make of success due to us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth is so obvious 'tis scarce worth enforcing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without our assistance they could not go coursing."<br /></span>

<span class="caption">&quot;Then the hound &amp; the Grey-hound both flew at the poodle&quot;</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"All you say," quoth the <span class="smcap">Harrier</span>, "dear coz, is most true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I think it but just, to give each Dog his due;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So don't be offended if <i>I</i> dare disclose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <i>you</i> are not gifted, like me, with a nose."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the <span class="smcap">Poodle</span> heard this, he laugh'd out aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the Curs grinned, who were mixed in the crowd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Hound and the Grey-hound both flew at the Poodle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called him a curl-coated Cur, and a noodle&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Poodle was frighten'd at what he had done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But being himself much addicted to fun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And having no notion of running by scent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not conceive the Hound seriously meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To say, that the Grey-hound had no nose at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he'd one twice as long as his own, tho' 'twas small.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Come have done with your jaw," said the <span class="smcap">Fox-hound</span> in spleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For how should a foreigner know what you mean?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May-hap he can dance, and I'm sure he can beg;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him run me a race, and I'll tye up a leg;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in hunting, in truth, the <span class="smcap">Harrier</span> and <span class="smcap">Beagle</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more equal us, than the Hawk does the Eagle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trotting after a Hare is mere childish play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may now and then serve, to kill a dull day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But <i>we</i>, at sun rise, seek the Fox in the cover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive him often before us, ten counties half over;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweep wild o'er the hill, or close at his brush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchecked thro' the gorse, and the river we rush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ph&#339;bus once more must sink down to his nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'er we slacken our chace, or betake us to rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tempting our sport, Men think it atones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the maiming of limbs and the breaking of bones."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said the <span class="smcap">Stag-hound</span>&mdash;"All rivalships here I disclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since for strength, and for speed, so well known is my fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I justly am reckon'd the first amongst hounds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet our chace like the <span class="smcap">Fox-hounds</span>, with danger abounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, is sometimes attended with fatal effects,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in hunting of Stags, men <i>have</i> broken their necks."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Oh pray say no more," said a poor <span class="smcap">meagre cur</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It grieves me to think men such dangers incur;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mankind, I'm a friend of the genuine breed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A friend little known, but in th' hour of need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this string round my neck I guide my poor master,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And true to his touch, I go slower or faster;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Pity his sorrows, for he is stone blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And without my assistance his way could not find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I lead him with caution through Alleys and Streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rejoice to observe the relief that he meets:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And when to our lodging at night we repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the food he's collected, he gives me a share."<br /></span>

</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then a <span class="smcap">Spaniel</span> advanced, with a courtier-like mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His manners were gentle, his coat soft, and clean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nose was jet black, and his ears were so long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They swept on the ground, as he passed through the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he spoke&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We boast to mankind an attachment so pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That docile, and patient, their blows we endure:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We can hunt, we can quest, and what's more we can trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A descent long ennobled by favour and grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For our ancestors portraits are still to be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those of the <i>Babes</i> of <i>King Charles</i> and his <i>Queen</i>."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"You boast of your rank, Sir," the <span class="smcap">Water-dog</span> cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he shook his rough coat, that was scarcely yet dried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But in sport who with me can compare?&mdash;have you seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the bush-fringed pool is mantled with green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I wind, thro' the reeds and the rushes, my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the haunt of the Snipe, or the Mallard betray?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, when loud sounds the Gun, aroused by the crash&nbsp;}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As the fall of the victim, is marked by the splash)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaping forward I bear off the prey at a dash?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      }<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<span class="i2">"Tis enough&mdash;you have merit&mdash;but I think it better<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mention my claims," quoth the feather-tailed <span class="smcap">Setter</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The dew of the morn I with rapture inhale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When check'd in my course, by the scent breathing gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In caution low crouching each gesture displays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the covey lies basking, or sportively plays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My net bearing master I watch as I creep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till encircled, the brood is enthralled at a sweep."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The <span class="smcap">Pointer</span> then rose, and observ'd&mdash;"Sir, your trade is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gentle and quiet, it might suit the ladies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor things who would scream at the sound of a gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which we <span class="smcap">Pointers</span> consider as part of the fun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We range the wide fallows, or quarter the stubble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the labouring sportsman, alive to each double,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hails the high stiffen'd tail, and the motionless joint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cautiously warns the whole field of the point;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by magic transfixt, all the signal obey&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the death dealing tube, he hastes up to his prey."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the Pointer a bandy leg'd <span class="smcap">Turnspit</span> replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All you've said, worthy kinsman, cannot be denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to pastimes and sports&mdash;but allow <i>me</i> to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I to men some good turns have done in my day.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When the sportsman returns to his meal, what avail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your ranging, and pointing, and high stiffen'd tail?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your posture so graceful, good Sir, you may boast it;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i2">A bristly Scotch <span class="smcap">Terrier</span>, his eyes black and keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus attack'd the last speaker&mdash;"Pray what do you mean?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To boast of your service no longer of use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you still roasted meat, there <i>might</i> be some excuse;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He tumbled,&mdash;fetch'd ball,&mdash;and down for dead lay,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then started alive to defend GEORGE THE THIRD,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And danced on the turf a graceful quadrille.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More <span class="smcap">Mongrels</span> rush forward, all eager to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How their masters they serve, and in what they excel;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(Who wrote both of beasts and of men in past ages,)<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That the <span class="smcap">Wolf-dogs</span> of <span class="smcap">Erin</span>, so fierce in their rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dared in war with the Lords of the Forest engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could I but meet with the beasts they have slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm the dog, my dear joy, to kill them again."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried the <span class="smcap">Mastiff</span> in haste, as he rose to reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Your merit, dread Sir, I don't mean to deny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For historical facts I'm inclined to rely on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tis said that your Ancestors vanquished the Lion;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Here a great dog observ'd&mdash;"Don't think me romantic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet my Parents were born beyond the Atlantic;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to brag of descent is not in my plan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For merit more sterling I'm valu'd by man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the journey of life, I his footsteps attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night I'm his guardian, by day I'm his friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My pastime's to dive in the River or Sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the rage of the deep has no terrors for me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor for pleasure alone these risks do I brave,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind fortune allowed me, my master to save,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, expiring, he struggled in vain with the wave." &nbsp;}<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Said the <span class="smcap">President</span> "Sir&mdash;I admire your skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I hear you're disposed your own mutton to kill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If true this report, don't think me too bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In advising you not to chuse Sheep from my fold."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The <span class="smcap">Learned-dog</span> next&mdash;"I boast not of my learning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though perhaps it has made me, than you more discerning;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I conceive you have none of you knowledge in Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficient of ancient Dogs' merits to speak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall mention a few&mdash;The first of them this is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor <span class="smcap">Arcus</span>, the Dog of the wandering Ulysses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lived, the return of his master to greet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bounding for joy, fell dead at his feet.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I doubt if you've heard Alcibiades name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Grecian fine gentleman, who, to his shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give the Athenians a subject to rail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deprived a most beautiful Dog of his tail."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the Council heard this, the great members growl'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every little Dog pitiously howl'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clamour subsided&mdash;The wise Dog again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resumed his harangue, in a tedious strain;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke of Theseus's hounds, of the true Spartan breed;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hounds of Act&aelig;on, so famed for their speed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of three-headed Cerberus, Guardian of Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Orpheus subdued with his musical spell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Hecuba changed, seeing dead Polydore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And became&mdash;Vide Ovid&mdash;(here he heard the Dogs snore)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Your patience my friends, I no longer will tire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But brief make excuses, at the earnest desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those friends from abroad, who all much lamented<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That chance or engagements their attendance prevented.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <span class="smcap">African-dog</span>, said, that he did not dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quit the warm coast of Guinea in clothing so spare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <span class="smcap">Lapland</span> and <span class="smcap">Dane-dog</span> the gay <span class="smcap">Pomeranian</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slender <span class="smcap">Italian</span>, sagacious <span class="smcap">Siberian</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All pleaded the times; some could not get passports,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some feared <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>, some were stopt by their own courts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some were mangy, distemper'd, and others insane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a few ladies <span class="smcap">Lap-dogs</span> afraid of the rain."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake&mdash;On the sudden a howling went round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From each <span class="smcap">Terrier</span> and <span class="smcap">Mastiff</span> and <span class="smcap">Pointer</span> and <span class="smcap">Hound</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, full in the midst of the council, a <span class="smcap">Cur</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Uprose to address them; blood-red was his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His carcase was fleshless, and shrill was his cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His knees were all bent, as with weakness he shook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death and starvation scowled in his look.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You may talk of Parnassus and Poets," he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Of their scorn, and neglect, may complain in your pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that is all vanity, folly, conceit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The disgust of the pamper'd, the pride of the great;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look at me; I am starved&mdash;In yon hamlet I dwelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And contented for years no distresses I felt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the TAX, that my master had no means to pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the comforts of home drove me famished away;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And back from the sight in horror they shrunk.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A silence ensued&mdash;Thus the president spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This Council, my friends, I wished to convoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our rights to assert, but though each dog pretends&nbsp;}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To valour, or beauty, or skill, yet my friends   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    }<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let no separate claims then this union betray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For remember the promise, <i>each dog has his day</i>.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tis our aggregate worth must our merits decide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our patience, sagacity, faithfulness tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We then shall deserve, if we don't obtain fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Poets, not we, incur the just blame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This perhaps too may cause our arch-foe to relent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And move to compassion the hard hearted D&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so, my companions, the good that may follow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is better than all we can get from APOLLO."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <span class="smcap">President</span> spoke, the fair omen they hail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in sign of delight each dog wagged his tail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus agreed, e'er they rose, their thanks were resolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nem</i>: <i>Con:</i> to the chair, and the meeting dissolved.<br /></span>
